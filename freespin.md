# The $100 Bonus That Followed Me Home

> They say nothing on the internet is really free. I used to laugh at that. Until the night I found **_the link_**. And the link found me back.

I’m not a gambler. Let’s get that out of the way. I’ve always been the kind of guy who reads the TOS before clicking “accept.” But on March 13th, at exactly 2:41 AM, I did something I never do.

I clicked a link that promised me **$100 free**.

No catch. No card. No deposit.  
Just pure bonus.

I’d been doomscrolling on an obscure subreddit dedicated to forgotten online games. Someone posted a single sentence:  
**“Play with fire. Win free money. Click if you’re brave enough.”**  

Then the link:  
👉 [Click Here If You Dare](https://afflat3e3.com/trk/lnk/E945A2F1-9278-436B-A222-D81E51C76A9E/?o=29399&c=918273&a=725889&k=4ECD097A82D70FB001BCB245D91493E2&l=33058)

I hesitated.

The post had zero upvotes. No comments. The user had deleted their account seconds after posting. My instincts screamed “bot,” but something about it — the hour, the silence, the wording — felt like a challenge.

So I clicked.

The page loaded slowly, like it didn’t want to be seen too fast.

A sleek interface appeared. Neon lights flickered at the edges of my screen. A voice, soft and feminine, said:  
> “Welcome, traveler. The house remembers you.”

Chills ran up my spine. I muted the tab. It didn’t matter. The voice kept speaking.

> “You have 100 credits waiting. Would you like to play?”

I clicked yes. The games began.

## A Casino That Wasn't There Yesterday

The layout was like any other online casino: slots, blackjack, roulette, even weird indie-style games with cryptic names like *Whispers in the Fog* and *Lucky Number XIII*. But everything felt... off.

The slot machine reels moved slower than usual, almost as if they were watching me. The cards in blackjack flipped with a delay, and once I swore I saw my reflection blink twice in the screen even though I didn’t.

Still — I played.

And I won. A lot.

Within twenty minutes, I had turned my bonus into $500. I clicked "Withdraw," expecting a wall of terms or ID verifications.

Instead, a message popped up:  
> “Congratulations. The house pays its debts. See you soon.”

The money hit my PayPal instantly. No strings.

I should have walked away.

## Things Got Weird

The next night, I had a dream. In it, I was back in the casino — but this time, it was real. I could smell the velvet curtains, hear chips clinking, taste the stale air of a place too old for time. And she was there.

The voice from the site.

She stood behind the roulette table, watching me silently. Her eyes were mirrors. Every time I tried to speak, she shook her head.

> “You came willingly,” she finally said. “That’s all we needed.”

I woke up gasping. My phone was in my hand, unlocked, browser open — the casino still running. No tabs, no app, just a fullscreen window that hadn’t been there before.

I checked the URL:  
👉 [https://afflat3e3.com/trk/lnk/E945A2F1-9278-436B-A222-D81E51C76A9E](https://afflat3e3.com/trk/lnk/E945A2F1-9278-436B-A222-D81E51C76A9E/?o=29399&c=918273&a=725889&k=4ECD097A82D70FB001BCB245D91493E2&l=33058)  
Same one. But the layout was different.

It welcomed me back.

## The Real World Glitches

Over the next few days, little things started happening.

- My lights flickered at 2:41 AM, every night.
- I started seeing playing cards in strange places — on bus seats, in my mailbox, even inside a bag of cereal.
- The woman’s voice — that soft casino whisper — would hum tunes from slot machines when I was falling asleep.

I tried deleting my history. Blocking the URL. Factory resetting my phone. It didn’t matter. The site always came back.

Once, I left my apartment and passed an alleyway I swear never existed. A glowing sign buzzed from inside:  
**"The House Never Forgets."**

## Desperate Measures

I went to a cybersecurity expert. Showed him the link. He clicked it.

“Looks like a normal casino affiliate link to me,” he shrugged.  
“Plenty of sites run promos like this. You probably got spooked by a dream.”

But when he opened the site, his browser crashed.

He tried again. His laptop turned off.

The third time, his power strip blew out completely.

He doesn’t answer my emails anymore.

## The Final Game

I’m writing this now not as a warning — but as an invitation. Because last night, the woman spoke to me again.

> “One last spin,” she said. “Win, and you’re free. Lose… and the house collects.”

I don’t know what that means. Maybe it’s just a game. Maybe it’s all in my head. Or maybe…

There’s something real behind that link.

If you’re curious — if you’ve ever felt like the world has secrets layered beneath the surface — you’re welcome to try.

But don’t do it lightly. And definitely don’t play after 3 AM.
